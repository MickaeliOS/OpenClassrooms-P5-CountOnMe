# OpenClassrooms-P5-CountOnMe

Looking for a calculator? You've come to the right place!

Introducing CountOnMe, a Swift-based calculator that provides essential operations to assist you with your calculations.
This project not only introduced me to Unit Testing but also allowed me to implement the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, a fundamental architectural pattern in iOS development.

As we progress through this project, I'm excited to see myself evolve into a full-fledged iOS developer. Stay connected and join me on this journey to explore the next exciting project!
